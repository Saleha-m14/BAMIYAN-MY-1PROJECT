# Testing
List of the main issues
1. In the idex.html file the width of images for Boddhas and Band-e Amir section was set with percentage and while validating the code with W3C Validator it caused an error.
- Solution: Removed the percentag and set the value with pixels.
2. The color of heading was not visible.
- Solution: Changed colors by using Coolers that match the whole page.
3. 
Apart from these issues that I mentioned there have been several minor issues. The majority of these issues have been due to miss spelled tags, attributes, closing tag, and other mistakes.
